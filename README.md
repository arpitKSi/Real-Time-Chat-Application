# âš¡ Real-Time Messaging System (MERN + WebSockets)



A high-performance real-time chat application built using the MERN stack and WebSockets, optimized for instant, low-latency communicationâ€”critical for high-frequency trading (HFT) and financial applications.

## ðŸš€ Features:

âœ… Ultra-Low-Latency Communication â€“ WebSockets-based real-time messaging with minimal delay, a key requirement in HFT systems.


âœ… Efficient Event-Driven Architecture â€“ Scalable Node.js + WebSocket server designed for high-throughput, real-time message delivery.


âœ… Optimized Data Persistence â€“ MongoDB storage for chat history, showcasing structured data management applicable to trade logs and financial data.


âœ… Real-Time Notifications & Typing Indicators â€“ Demonstrates event-driven programming principles relevant to order book updates and trade alerts.


âœ… Secure Authentication â€“ JWT-based authentication, ensuring secure access, similar to API security in trading systems.


âœ… Scalability & Performance â€“ Built to handle multiple concurrent users efficiently, mirroring challenges in HFT environments.



## Tech Stack:

### Backend: Node.js, Express.js, WebSockets (Socket.io), JWT


### Frontend: React.js with WebSocket integration


### Database: MongoDB (for message persistence, similar to storing trade logs in financial systems)
